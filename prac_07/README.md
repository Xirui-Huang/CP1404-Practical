# Clean Code Principles in CP1404
# About the Repo and Myself
This repository serves as a collection of my learnings and assignments from the CP1404 course, focusing on the principles of clean code and programming patterns. As a student of this course, I've been dedicated to enhancing my coding practices to write more readable, efficient, and maintainable code. My journey through CP1404 has been both challenging and rewarding, providing me with a solid foundation in software development principles.

# Lessons Learned
Readability Over Complexity: One of the most critical lessons learned is the importance of writing code that is easy to read and understand by humans, not just machines. Simple and clear code often leads to fewer bugs and easier maintenance.
Refactoring is Key: Regularly refactoring code to improve its structure and reduce redundancy without changing its external behavior is crucial. It helps in keeping the code base clean and adaptable to changes.
Consistent Coding Standards: Adhering to a consistent set of coding standards and naming conventions across the project makes the code more uniform and easier to follow. It also aids in team collaboration, as everyone follows the same guidelines.
